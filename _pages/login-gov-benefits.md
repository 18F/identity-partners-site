Our vision is to create a single trusted account for the public to access all U.S. government digital services. 

- **Empowers people** to feel safe signing into government websites and accessing federal services online with a single, privacy-protected account.
- **One account** for every federal government service a user will interact with
- **Secure and private** authentication experience with opt-in user consent
- **Convenience** of identity verification from home
- **Simple tools** to manage and update their account
- **Support** through out the customer experience, with descriptive help content, and a staffed contact center for user support
