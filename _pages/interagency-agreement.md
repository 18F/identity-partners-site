# Interagency Agreements
Partnership and financial engagement will be governed by an Interagency Agreement (IAA)

login.gov is a cost-recoverable federal service, which means we must, by law, charge other agencies for our work. Our partnership and financial engagement will be governed by an Interagency Agreement (IAA), which includes forms 7600A and 7600B.  If we decide to move forward in a partnership, the next step is to sign an interagency agreement, or join an existing one with your agency. Let’s learn about what these agreements are, what the process is to sign one together or how to find out if your agency has an existing one you can join.

## What is an Interagency Agreement
Agencies typically sign two Department of the Treasury forms  in the Interagency Agreement to become Partners with login.gov

## General Terms and Conditions
General Terms and Conditions (GT&C), also known as the 7600A. The 7600A form is mostly boilerplate information about your agency and a broad outline of the nature of the relationship between our agencies.

## Order Requirements and Funding Information
The 7600B lays out the specifics of what login.gov and your agency will do during this relationship and has more specific information like period of performance, funding information cost, and a Statement of Work.
Signing an Interagency Agreement

By signing this agreement, your agency authorizes the General Terms and Conditions as stated, and that the scope of the work can be fulfilled. By signing, you agree to periodically review the terms and conditions of the agreement and make any necessary modifications to the GT&C and any affected Order(s).

An Agency Official must sign the 7600A form. A Program Official and a Funding Official must sign the 7600B form. Once all signatures are in place from both your agency and GSA, the agreement is executed. The agreement becomes active on the start date of the period of performance and expires on the end date.

## Typical steps to establish an interagency agreement

- Provide us a description of your application(s), URLs, their estimated user volume and transactions, and anything else we should know
- Provide an estimate of total unique users (over the course of a year), transactions and traffic patterns
- Plan for a launch date
- login.gov will work with your agency to complete agreement paperwork and set pricing tiers

## Join your agency’s existing interagency agreement
Steps to join an existing interagency agreement:

An active interagency agreement must be in place before your application integration with login.gov services can be released to production and then launched. If you would like to include your application under an already established IAA, we will need for each of the applications the following information:

- Application name
- Application URL
- Brief description of the application
- Estimated number of total users annually
- Estimated number of transactions annually
- Type of login.gov services - IAL1 (authentication only) or IAL2 (auth with ID proofing):
- Technical point of contact
- Program point of contact

With that information, we will check that your estimated usage falls within the terms of the IAA. If it does, we will obtain a go-ahead from your agency’s IAA POC to include your application. If it does not, we will ask your agency’s IAA POC if we can perform a modification to include your application.

Just check with us if you are unsure if your agency has an IAA for login.gov services.

## Create a new interagency agreement
