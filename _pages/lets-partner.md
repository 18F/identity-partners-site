# Ready to partner? Let's go!

Here's the steps to use login.gov at your agency:

1. Let us know you're [ready to partner]({{ site.baseurl }})
2. Sign an interagency agreement (IAA) with the U.S. General Services Administration
  - We'll send you all the paperwork
  - This can take about 50 days, so please plan accordingly!
3. Get a working integration in our [sandbox]({{ site.baseurl }}/sandbox)
4. Prepare your users for the new login.gov experience
5. Launch and test your live login.gov integration 🚀
6. Post-launch, keep up with changes and keep your users happy

# The launch checklist

## Agreements and planning

☑️ Interagency agreement (IAA) is fully executed (or you have approval to join an existing one at your agency)
☑️ Plan for a launch date (when you'd like a login.gov integration to be available to your users)
☑️ Sandbox integrations are working as expected

☑️ Review your UX
  - Conduct a walkthrough of log in, log out, and identity proofing user flows
  - Determine if login.gov help text is needed at sign up, sign in, and forgot password

☑️ Create a user-support plan
  - Inform your support resources of the integration with login.gov (if applicable)
  - Inform the login.gov contact center of your application, screenshots, any specific help guidance, URLs and contact info for your support center resources

☑️ Prepare user communications, send announcements

## Pre-launch

☑️ Your application is made available in the login.gov production environment _(Do not make your login.gov integration available to your users yet!)_

☑️ Conduct testing to prepare for launch (at least a few days is recommended)
  - Are login.gov production URLs referenced by the application?
  - Does the integration work as expected?
  - Perform any final checks with your team and the login.gov team

☑️ Subscribe to login.gov status updates at [logingov.statuspage.io](https://logingov.statuspage.io)

## Launch 🚀

☑️ Make your login.gov integration available to your users
  - Change URL endpoints to **`https://secure.login.gov`**

## Post-launch

☑️ Schedule check-ins with the login.gov team if needed
☑️ Inform the login.gov team of any change in points-of-contact
☑️ Update certificates before expiration
☑️ Reach out to partners@login.gov for help or questions
