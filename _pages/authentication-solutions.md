# login.gov’s authentication and proofing solutions

login.gov offers secure two-factor authentication with widely available as well as unphishable methods. This service provides users with secure access to digital services at over 17 different government agencies with a single set of credentials. For you, this means leveraging the best security defined by NIST 800-63 Identity Assurance Level 1 and Authentication Assurance Level 2, and FedRAMP Moderate while complying with 21st Century Idea Act in a easy-to-use experience.

login.gov identity verification builds on the security of our authentication service and provides a remote proofing experience using an individual’s state-issued ID rather than knowledge-based verification. Our remote proofing implementation complies with NIST’s IAL2. The login.gov verified accounts (IAL2/AAL2) allows applications to access verified attributes about a user such as a phone number and a social security number while maintaining user privacy by requiring the user’s consent and password to decrypt the data.

## Authentication

We offer two levels of identity assurance within our platform. For our login.gov basic authentication accounts (IAL1/AAL2), we rely on the user having access to an email address and a secure multi-factor method such as a phone or PIV/CAC.

We want to offer secure and modern authentication to the entire US public. Federal agencies and the public benefit from login.gov because

- it provides the **highest security** that meets both FedRAMP and NIST identity standards,
- it **saves taxpayer funds**  by centralizing login as a shared government service,
- and provides a **world-class customer experience** for the public.

We are also keeping ahead of evolving security threats by leading industry in adopting emerging authentication security methods such as WebAuthn and building a product to encourage more secure methods.

## Identity Proofing

NIST defines identity proofing as “The process by which a [credentialing service provider] collects, validates, and verifies information about a person.” This is the process login.gov uses to verify that you are who you say you are. While many agencies can validate an individual’s identity through an in-person proofing experience, we developed an online application that allows individuals to have their identities verified from their smartphone or computer.

We provide an online remote identity proofing platform that allows agencies to verify that their users are who they say they are from the convenience of their own home. We have worked with some of the most recognizable brands in the Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM) space to bring one solution to the federal government. login.gov meets NIST’s Identity Assurance Level 2 making it a great fit for applications that need to feel confident about their users.

For identity verified accounts at the NIST 800-63 IAL2 level, we ask users to upload a photograph of their state-issued ID and we verify that information against Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) records. As a fallback we can also leverage address verification by mail. Users must also provide their phone numbers and SSN, which are validated against their known phone bill for accuracy.

To improve proofing coverage, we plan on expanding our use of data sources to include government data sources not available through traditional commercial data sources as we are a trusted federal entity. Likewise, we plan on integrating with in-person proofing services offered by the USPS.
