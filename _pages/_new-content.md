# What is online identity proofing?

Login.gov’s online identity proofing platform allows agencies to verify that their users are who they say they are from the convenience of their own home. 

All the user will need to do is follow this three step process:

1. Upload an image of their state-issued ID
2. Enter their Social Security Number (SSN)
3. Prove their address with a phone number or by mail

Login.gov worked with some of the most recognizable brands in the identity space to bring one solution to the federal government. Login.gov meets NIST’s Identity Assurance Level 2 making it a great fit for applications that need to feel confident about their users.
