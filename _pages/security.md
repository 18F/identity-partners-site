# login.gov Security

Being deliberate about security means focusing our attention on what needs to be protected. It means thinking carefully about how to balance protection and accessibility. Doing this successfully includes educating users about how they can protect themselves or mitigate the effects of crime.
In login.gov’s case, for instance, we have to decide exactly what data we store and for how long. We also have to decide what steps users must take to access their information. All of these decisions take careful deliberation to determine what’s the best option for both users and agencies and to ensure maximum functionality.
